# Numerical Methods Toolkit (MATLAB)

This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts implementing a wide range of numerical methods. These were developed as part of my undergraduate coursework in **Numerical Analysis** at Jadavpur University. To reinforce my understanding beyond the classroom, I implemented each method from scratch, added extra techniques, and structured them into a well-organized project.

## 🎓 About the Project

The goal of this project was not only to complete coursework but to truly grasp how numerical algorithms work under the hood. I coded all the algorithms manually without relying on external packages, using MATLAB's basic programming constructs to simulate what real solvers do. This repository serves both as a **learning archive** and a **reference toolkit**.

## 🧠 Educational Focus

This project emphasizes:
- Core algorithmic understanding (not just applying built-in solvers).
- Practical application of mathematical theory to code.
- Breadth of topics: equations, calculus, systems, and modeling.

It is ideal for students, educators, and anyone wanting a hands-on foundation in numerical methods.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/numerical-methods-matlab.git
   cd numerical-methods-matlab
   ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder of interest.

3. Run any `.m` file directly. Each is standalone with test values and display output.
